# GPUGrass
real-time grass rendering based on GPU instancing with Unity  
[用Unity实现基于GPU实例化的大批量草地渲染（上）](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/585968277?)  
  
this Unity project is a naive implementation of:  
Zengzhi Fan , Hongwei Li , Karl Hillesland , Bin Sheng. Simulation and rendering for millions of grass blades. Proceedings of the 19th Symposium on Interactive 3D Graphics and Games. 2015  
Specifically, compares to the paper, this implementation lacks physics simulation (interactions with colliders or wind)
